This folder contains older versions of a SQL script for generating a blank ODM2 database within PostgreSQL.  These were created using an older process. We have a new process for automatically generating the DDL SQL scripts from Python code.

**Naming conventions:** Note that the ODM2 information model is being designed using a CamelCase naming convention. In this POsgreSQL SQL script, this convention has been changed to result in an all-lower-case convention.
